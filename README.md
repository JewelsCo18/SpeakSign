# Virtualenv cheatsheet
- ./setup.sh (creates new virtualenv)
- source activate (starts virtualenv)
- python main.py (runs main *make sure virtualenv is active!*)

# Git cheatsheet
- git add . (adds all files in current directory)
- git add <filename> (adds file that is specified)
- git commit -m "commit message" (commits all files that have been added to local repo)
- git push (pushes local commits to repo on github.com)
- git push --set-upstream origin master (should only need to be run when pushing for the first time)
